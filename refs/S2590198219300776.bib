abstract = {Understanding the factors that impact commuter's transport mode choice is one of the important key aspects to consider when aiming for a sustainable transportation system, especially in developing countries where this is still a relatively new concept. This study aims to examine and rank the factors that commuters in selected urban cities in the Philippines perceive to significantly affect their transport mode choice. Data collected from three urban cities in Metro Cebu are used to determine which factors and transport mode choice are prioritized based on demographic and socioeconomic segments as well as reasons for travelling. Factors and modes of transportation are ranked using analytic hierarchy process. Key findings show that regardless of age, gender, income and intent of travel, safety is ranked first over accessibility, cost of travel, comfort and concern for environment. Despite the worsening traffic conditions and increasing cost of travel, private and semi-private for-hire vehicles are highly ranked over various mass transport systems when all factors are simultaneously considered. It is noteworthy to see how factors are ranked 2nd after safety by each group. The results can be used by policymakers to evaluate and develop relevant transport policies that complement a sustainable transport system.}
